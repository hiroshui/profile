## üîß Profile

I started my professional journey with an apprenticeship as an application developer at fme AG, where I gradually advanced through various roles ‚Äî from software developer and ECM specialist to today's position as a senior consultant and technical lead in cloud infrastructure.

After my initial focus on software development and enterprise content management, I transitioned into the cloud domain. Today, I focus on the architecture, deployment, migration, and operations of applications and platforms in both private and public cloud environments.

My core strengths include Kubernetes, CI/CD automation (DevOps), infrastructure as code (GitOps), and cloud-native security (GitSecOps).

I have extensive project experience in highly regulated industries such as the public sector, automotive, finance, and pharmaceuticals.
