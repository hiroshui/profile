## 🔧 Profile

Senior Cloud and DevOps specialist with 13 years of experience in the IT industry.

Originally trained as a software developer, I transitioned into Enterprise Content Management and later into cloud infrastructure. Today, I focus on architecture, deployment, migration, and operations of applications and platforms in private and public clouds.

My strengths lie in Kubernetes, CI/CD automation (DevOps), infrastructure-as-code (GitOps), and cloud-native security (GitSecOps).

Project experience in highly regulated industries such as public sector, automotive, finance, and pharmaceuticals.
